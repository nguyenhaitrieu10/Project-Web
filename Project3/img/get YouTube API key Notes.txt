YouTube Data API (v3)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/

"You can use the API to fetch search results and to retrieve, insert, update, and delete resources like videos or playlists."

Go to APIs & auth (left side) > APIs (then Browse APIs, scroll down to find YouTube Data API and change status to "On")

API Reference:
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/
Find "Resource Types" here
Click "Search"
Click "list" (it is the only method given for Search)

https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search/list

Provides a GET request for our form, and a list of all parameters we can include. (So cool!) E.g. you can limit it to one channel, and so on. 
A "snippet" is all the summary stuff about a video: title, short description, thumbnail.

	"in a search result, the snippet property contains other properties that 
	identify the result's title, description, and so forth. If you set 
	part=snippet, the API response will also contain all of those nested 
	properties. (string)"

q is a parameter that specifies the query term to search for.

We are not using the JavaScript client library (however, one does exist!); in this tutorial, we are just making straight GET requests (using jQuery get() method).
